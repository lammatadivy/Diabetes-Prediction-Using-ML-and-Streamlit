# Diabetes-Prediction-Using-ML-and-Streamlit

Diabetes Prediction is one such Machine learning model which helps to detect diabetes in humans. This workflow to build the end-to-end Machine learning project to predict diabetes is as follows:
1. Collection of data
2. Exploring the data
3. Splitting the data
4. Training the data
5. Evaluting the model
6. Deploying the model

one of the most important and final steps in buliding a machine learning project is model deployment.so deploy model using Streamlit.
To install Streamlit run the following command in the command prompt or terminal.
    ***pip install streamlit***
And then to deploy using streamlit go to command prompt and run the following command.
   ***streamlit run App.py
            (or)
  streamlit run filename.py***
